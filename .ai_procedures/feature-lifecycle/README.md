# Feature Lifecycle

## Overview

This folder contains end-to-end procedures for feature development from initial intake through post-deployment validation. Follow these procedures when developing new features or significant enhancements.

## Master Orchestration Procedure

- **[Feature Implementation Orchestration](./feature-implementation-orchestration-procedure.md)** - Complete workflow orchestrator that coordinates all phases

## Lifecycle Stages

### 1. Planning & Design
- [Feature Intake Procedure](./feature-intake-procedure.md)
- [Requirements & Scope Procedure](./requirements-scope-procedure.md)
- [User Journey / UX Procedure](./user-journey-ux-procedure.md)
- [Architecture Review Procedure](./architecture-review-procedure.md)
- [Threat Model Procedure](./threat-model-procedure.md)

### 2. Technical Design
- [Data Design Procedure](./data-design-procedure.md) (DynamoDB + Postgres)
- [API Contract Procedure](./api-contract-procedure.md) (CRITICAL - all implementation layers depend on this)
- [Third-Party Integration Procedure](./third-party-integration-procedure.md)
- [AuthN/AuthZ Procedure](./authn-authz-procedure.md)

### 3. Implementation
- [Backend Implementation Procedure](./backend-implementation-procedure.md)
- [Frontend Implementation Procedure](./frontend-implementation-procedure.md)
- [Middleware Implementation Procedure](./middleware-implementation-procedure.md)
- [IaC/Infrastructure Update Procedure](./iac-infrastructure-update-procedure.md)
- [Architecture Compliance Validation Procedure](./architecture-compliance-validation-procedure.md) (checkpoints during implementation)
- [Change Management Procedure](./change-management-procedure.md) (as needed during implementation)

### 4. Quality Assurance
- [Test Plan Procedure](./test-plan-procedure.md)
- [Implementation Verification Procedure](./implementation-verification-procedure.md)
- [Integration Testing Procedure](./integration-testing-procedure.md)
- [End-to-End Testing Procedure](./end-to-end-testing-procedure.md)
- [Post-Implementation Architecture Assessment Procedure](./post-implementation-architecture-assessment-procedure.md)
- [Security Review Procedure](./security-review-procedure.md)
- [Accessibility Review Procedure](./accessibility-review-procedure.md)
- [Performance & Resilience Procedure](./performance-resilience-procedure.md)
- [Observability Instrumentation Procedure](./observability-instrumentation-procedure.md)

### 5. Pre-Deployment
- [Documentation & Runbook Procedure](./documentation-runbook-procedure.md) ✅
- [Feature Flag / Rollout Procedure](./feature-flag-rollout-procedure.md) ✅
- [Acceptance & Signoff Procedure](./acceptance-signoff-procedure.md) ✅
- [Rollback Procedure](./rollback-procedure.md) (if deployment fails)

### 6. Deployment
- [Feature Deployment Procedure](./feature-deployment-procedure.md) ✅

- **Data Lifecycle** - If schema changes are involved
- **API Lifecycle** - If new or modified APIs are part of the feature
- **Testing Quality Lifecycle** - For test planning and execution
- **Release Lifecycle** - For feature deployment
