# Procedure: Change Approval (Governance & Compliance)

### 1. Purpose

**Why this procedure exists**

This procedure defines the governance layer for change approval: policy, approval authority, and compliance. It ensures [Change Management Change Approval](../change-management-lifecycle/change-approval-procedure.md) operates within governed policy and that [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) can demonstrate change governance. Operational approval workflow remains in [Change Management Lifecycle](../change-management-lifecycle/).

**What problem it solves**

- Change approval policy or authority unclear; inconsistent governance
- [Change Management Change Approval](../change-management-lifecycle/change-approval-procedure.md) used but governance (policy, compliance) not defined
- [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) or compliance require change approval governance documentation
- CAB, change authority, or delegation not established

**What "success" looks like at the end**

Change approval governance defined and applied with:
- Change approval policy (what requires approval, who can approve, emergency vs standard) and approval authority (CAB, change manager, delegate) documented
- [Change Management Change Approval](../change-management-lifecycle/change-approval-procedure.md) used for execution; governance policy enforced
- [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) includes change approval governance; compliance demonstrated
- Links to [Change Management Lifecycle](../change-management-lifecycle/), [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md)

---

### 2. Trigger

- Governance or compliance requires change approval policy and authority
- [Change Management Change Approval](../change-management-lifecycle/change-approval-procedure.md) needs governance (policy, authority) to operate
- Audit or regulatory review of change governance
- CAB, change manager, or delegation change

---

### 3. Required Inputs

**Artifacts:** [Change Management Change Approval](../change-management-lifecycle/change-approval-procedure.md) (execution); compliance or audit requirements; existing change practice.  
**Decisions:** Owner (compliance, change manager); approval authority and policy.  
**Constraints:** Policy must be clear; authority assigned; evidence retained for audit.

**Remediation:** Authority or policy unclear → define minimal (approval authority, standard vs emergency); refine with compliance.

---

### 4. Plan Requirement

**Plan includes:** Policy, approval authority, standard vs emergency, delegation, links to change management and audit evidence. **Output:** Change Approval Governance Plan.

---

### 5. Workflow

**Step 1: Define policy and authority.** Document change approval policy (what requires approval, when); define approval authority (CAB, change manager, delegates). Distinguish standard vs emergency change. **Outputs:** Policy; authority.

**Step 2: Align with Change Management.** Ensure [Change Management Change Approval](../change-management-lifecycle/change-approval-procedure.md) uses governed policy and authority; operational workflow unchanged. **Outputs:** Alignment with change management.

**Step 3: Evidence and maintain.** Retain approval decisions and policy for [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md). Update policy or authority when governance changes. **Outputs:** Audit evidence; maintenance process.

---

### 6. Output Contract

**Artifacts:** Change approval policy, approval authority, audit evidence linkage. **State:** Change approval governance defined and applied. **Signals:** “Change approval governance defined”.

---

### 7. Validation & Acceptance Criteria

**Checks:** Policy and authority defined; change management aligned; audit evidence. **Who approves:** Compliance, change manager.

---

### 8. Downstream Dependencies

**Output →:** [Change Management Change Approval Procedure](../change-management-lifecycle/change-approval-procedure.md), [Audit Evidence Procedure](./audit-evidence-procedure.md). **Depends on:** Compliance and audit requirements.

---

### 9. Definition of Done

- [ ] Policy and authority defined
- [ ] Change management aligned; governance applied
- [ ] Audit evidence for change governance

---

### 10. Audit & Traceability

**Links to:** Policy, authority, change management, audit evidence. **Audit trail:** Policy updates, authority changes.

---

### 11. Exit States

**✅ Completed successfully** – Change approval governance defined and applied. **⚠️ Blocked** – Policy or authority unclear; resolve with compliance. **❌ Aborted** – Governance work cancelled; document reason.

**Status:** Active Procedure  
**Owner:** Compliance / Change manager
