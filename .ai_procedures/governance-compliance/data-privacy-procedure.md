# Procedure: Data Privacy (Governance & Compliance)

### 1. Purpose

**Why this procedure exists**

This procedure defines how to achieve and maintain data privacy compliance (e.g. GDPR, CCPA) so that personal data is processed lawfully, minimal, and secure. It ensures [Data Classification](../data-lifecycle/data-classification-procedure.md), [Data Retention & Deletion](../data-lifecycle/data-retention-deletion-procedure.md), and [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md) align with privacy policy and regulation, and that [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) can demonstrate compliance.

**What problem it solves**

- No data privacy process; regulatory or customer trust risk
- [Data Lifecycle](../data-lifecycle/) or [Third-Party](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/) procedures not aligned with privacy policy
- Subject rights (access, erasure, portability) or breach notification not defined
- [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) or [Governance](./) lack privacy compliance coverage

**What "success" looks like at the end**

Data privacy compliance operational with:
- Privacy policy and lawful basis documented; [Data Classification](../data-lifecycle/data-classification-procedure.md), [Retention & Deletion](../data-lifecycle/data-retention-deletion-procedure.md), [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md) aligned
- Subject rights process (access, erasure, portability, etc.) and breach notification defined and used
- [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) includes privacy; compliance demonstrated
- Links to [Data Lifecycle](../data-lifecycle/), [Third-Party](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/), [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md)

---

### 2. Trigger

- New processing of personal data; privacy compliance required
- [Data Classification](../data-lifecycle/data-classification-procedure.md), [Data Retention & Deletion](../data-lifecycle/data-retention-deletion-procedure.md), or [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md) require privacy policy alignment
- Subject rights request (access, erasure, etc.) or breach; process must be executed
- Audit or regulatory review of data privacy

---

### 3. Required Inputs

**Artifacts:** Privacy policy; [Data Classification](../data-lifecycle/data-classification-procedure.md), [Data Retention & Deletion](../data-lifecycle/data-retention-deletion-procedure.md), [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md) outputs; applicable regulation (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).  
**Decisions:** Owner (compliance, legal, DPO); lawful basis and purpose.  
**Constraints:** Lawful basis, minimization, retention, and rights per regulation.

**Remediation:** Privacy policy or regulation unclear → define minimal (lawful basis, retention, rights); align with legal.

---

### 4. Plan Requirement

**Plan includes:** Privacy policy, lawful basis, alignment with data lifecycle and third-party, subject rights, breach notification, audit evidence. **Output:** Data Privacy Plan.

---

### 5. Workflow

**Step 1: Document policy and alignment.** Document privacy policy, lawful basis, purpose; ensure [Data Classification](../data-lifecycle/data-classification-procedure.md), [Retention & Deletion](../data-lifecycle/data-retention-deletion-procedure.md), [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md) align. **Outputs:** Policy; alignment.

**Step 2: Define subject rights and breach notification.** Define process for access, erasure, portability, etc.; define breach detection and notification. **Outputs:** Subject rights process; breach notification process.

**Step 3: Operate and evidence.** Execute subject rights and breach process when triggered; collect [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) for privacy compliance. **Outputs:** Operational privacy; audit evidence.

---

### 6. Output Contract

**Artifacts:** Privacy policy, subject rights process, breach notification process, audit evidence. **State:** Data privacy compliance operational. **Signals:** “Data privacy compliance maintained”.

---

### 7. Validation & Acceptance Criteria

**Checks:** Policy and alignment; subject rights and breach process defined and used; audit evidence. **Who approves:** Compliance, legal, DPO.

---

### 8. Downstream Dependencies

**Output →:** [Audit Evidence Procedure](./audit-evidence-procedure.md), [Data Classification](../data-lifecycle/data-classification-procedure.md), [Data Retention & Deletion](../data-lifecycle/data-retention-deletion-procedure.md), [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md). **Depends on:** Privacy regulation.

---

### 9. Definition of Done

- [ ] Policy and alignment documented
- [ ] Subject rights and breach process defined and used
- [ ] Audit evidence for privacy collected

---

### 10. Audit & Traceability

**Links to:** Policy, data lifecycle, third-party, audit evidence. **Audit trail:** Subject rights, breaches, reviews.

---

### 11. Exit States

**✅ Completed successfully** – Data privacy compliance operational. **⚠️ Blocked** – Policy or regulation unclear; resolve with legal. **❌ Aborted** – Data privacy work cancelled; document reason.

---

**Status:** Active Procedure  
**Owner:** Compliance / Legal / DPO
