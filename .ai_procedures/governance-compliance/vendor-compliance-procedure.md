# Procedure: Vendor Compliance (Governance & Compliance)

### 1. Purpose

**Why this procedure exists**

This procedure defines how to ensure third-party vendors meet compliance and governance requirements (security, privacy, regulatory). It ensures [Vendor Evaluation](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md), [Contract & SLA](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md), and [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md) incorporate compliance criteria and that [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) can demonstrate vendor compliance.

**What problem it solves**

- Vendors adopted without compliance check; regulatory or security risk
- [Vendor Evaluation](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md) or [Contract & SLA](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md) lack compliance dimension
- [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) or regulator requests vendor compliance proof
- No ongoing vendor compliance review (e.g. SOC 2, GDPR processor)

**What "success" looks like at the end**

Vendor compliance operational with:
- Compliance criteria (security, privacy, regulatory) for vendor selection and contract; [Vendor Evaluation](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md) and [Contract & SLA](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md) aligned
- Ongoing vendor compliance review (certifications, processor terms, etc.) and [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md) collected
- Links to [Vendor Evaluation](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md), [Contract & SLA](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md), [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md), [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md)

---

### 2. Trigger

- New vendor; compliance must be assessed per [Vendor Evaluation](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md) and governance
- [Contract & SLA](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md) or [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md) touch compliance; vendor compliance process needed
- Periodic vendor compliance review (e.g. annual)
- Audit or regulatory request for vendor compliance evidence

---

### 3. Required Inputs

**Artifacts:** Compliance requirements (security, privacy, regulatory); [Vendor Evaluation](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md), [Contract & SLA](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md), [Data Mapping & Privacy](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md) outputs; vendor certifications or attestations.  
**Decisions:** Owner (compliance, procurement); review cadence and criteria.  
**Constraints:** Vendors must meet compliance criteria or risk accepted; evidence retained.

**Remediation:** Criteria unclear → define minimal (security, data handling); align with compliance.

---

### 4. Plan Requirement

**Plan includes:** Compliance criteria, vendor evaluation and contract alignment, ongoing review, audit evidence. **Output:** Vendor Compliance Plan.

---

### 5. Workflow

**Step 1: Define compliance criteria.** Define what vendors must meet (security, privacy, regulatory, certifications); ensure [Vendor Evaluation](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md) and [Contract & SLA](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md) include these. **Outputs:** Criteria; evaluation and contract alignment.

**Step 2: Assess and contract.** Use [Vendor Evaluation](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md) and [Contract & SLA](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md) with compliance criteria; retain evidence (certifications, DPA, etc.). **Outputs:** Vendor assessed; contract with compliance terms.

**Step 3: Ongoing review and evidence.** Periodic vendor compliance review (e.g. annual); collect [Audit Evidence](./audit-evidence-procedure.md). Update when vendor or regulation changes. **Outputs:** Review process; audit evidence.

---

### 6. Output Contract

**Artifacts:** Vendor compliance criteria, assessment, contract alignment, review process, audit evidence. **State:** Vendor compliance operational. **Signals:** “Vendor compliance maintained”.

---

### 7. Validation & Acceptance Criteria

**Checks:** Criteria defined; evaluation and contract aligned; ongoing review and evidence. **Who approves:** Compliance, procurement.

---

### 8. Downstream Dependencies

**Output →:** [Audit Evidence Procedure](./audit-evidence-procedure.md), [Vendor Evaluation Procedure](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/vendor-evaluation-procedure.md), [Contract & SLA Procedure](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/contract-sla-procedure.md), [Data Mapping & Privacy Procedure](../third-party-integration-lifecycle/data-mapping-privacy-procedure.md). **Depends on:** Compliance requirements.

---

### 9. Definition of Done

- [ ] Compliance criteria defined; evaluation and contract aligned
- [ ] Vendors assessed and contracted with compliance
- [ ] Ongoing review and audit evidence

---

### 10. Audit & Traceability

**Links to:** Criteria, vendor evaluation, contract, audit evidence. **Audit trail:** Vendor reviews, certifications.

---

### 11. Exit States

**✅ Completed successfully** – Vendor compliance operational. **⚠️ Blocked** – Criteria or evidence missing; resolve with compliance. **❌ Aborted** – Vendor compliance work cancelled; document reason.

**Status:** Active Procedure  
**Owner:** Compliance / Procurement
