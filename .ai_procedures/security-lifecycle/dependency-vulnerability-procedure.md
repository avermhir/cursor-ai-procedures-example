# Procedure: Dependency & Vulnerability (Security Lifecycle)

### 1. Purpose

**Why this procedure exists**

This procedure defines how to track, assess, and remediate dependency vulnerabilities (e.g. CVEs, SCA) so that known vulnerabilities are addressed per risk and [Security Logging](./security-logging-procedure.md) and compliance can reference dependency hygiene.

**What problem it solves**

- Vulnerable dependencies unnoticed or unaddressed; exploitation risk
- No prioritization or ownership; backlog of vulns without action
- [PR Lifecycle](../pr-lifecycle/) or CI cannot assume consistent dependency checks
- Compliance or audit requires vulnerability management evidence

**What "success" looks like at the end**

Dependency and vulnerability management operational with:
- Inventory and vulnerability scanning (SCA, CVE) in place
- Triage, prioritization, and remediation process; ownership clear
- CI or PR checks for new vulnerabilities; [Security Logging](./security-logging-procedure.md) where applicable
- Links to [Security Review](../feature-lifecycle/security-review-procedure.md), [CI Quality Gates](../testing-quality-lifecycle/ci-quality-gates-procedure.md), compliance

---

### 2. Trigger

- New or updated dependencies; vulnerability scan or CVE alert
- [Security Review](../feature-lifecycle/security-review-procedure.md) or [CI Quality Gates](../testing-quality-lifecycle/ci-quality-gates-procedure.md) include dependency checks
- Periodic vulnerability scan; triage and remediate
- Security incident or audit; dependency vulns must be tracked and addressed

---

### 3. Required Inputs

**Artifacts:** Dependency inventory (e.g. lockfiles, SCA tool); vulnerability feed or scanner; [Security Logging](./security-logging-procedure.md) if vuln events logged.  
**Decisions:** Owner (security, platform); triage criteria and SLA (e.g. critical fix within X days).  
**Constraints:** Critical/high vulns must be triaged and remediated or accepted with documented risk.

**Remediation:** Scanner or inventory missing → introduce SCA/vuln scanning; document scope and cadence.

---

### 4. Plan Requirement

**Plan includes:** Inventory, scanning, triage, prioritization, remediation, CI integration, logging. **Output:** Dependency & Vulnerability Plan.

---

### 5. Workflow

**Step 1: Inventory and scan.** Maintain dependency inventory; run vulnerability scans (CI, periodic). **Outputs:** Inventory; scan results.

**Step 2: Triage and prioritize.** Triage vulns (critical/high/medium/low); prioritize by exploitability, exposure, and SLA. Assign owner. **Outputs:** Triage and prioritization; owner.

**Step 3: Remediate or accept.** Remediate (upgrade, patch, replace) per priority; or accept risk with documented justification. Re-scan; track to closure. **Outputs:** Remediation or acceptance; re-scan confirmation.

---

### 6. Output Contract

**Artifacts:** Inventory, scan results, triage, remediation or acceptance records. **State:** Vulns tracked and addressed. **Signals:** “Dependency vulns triaged”; “Remediation complete”.

---

### 7. Validation & Acceptance Criteria

**Checks:** Inventory and scanning in place; triage and prioritization done; critical/high remediated or accepted. **Who approves:** Security owner, platform owner.

---

### 8. Downstream Dependencies

**Output →:** [Security Logging Procedure](./security-logging-procedure.md), [Security Review Procedure](../feature-lifecycle/security-review-procedure.md), [CI Quality Gates Procedure](../testing-quality-lifecycle/ci-quality-gates-procedure.md), compliance. **Depends on:** SCA/vuln tooling.

---

### 9. Definition of Done

- [ ] Inventory and scanning in place
- [ ] Triage and prioritization process; ownership clear
- [ ] Critical/high remediated or accepted; re-scan confirmed

---

### 10. Audit & Traceability

**Links to:** Inventory, scan results, triage, remediation. **Audit trail:** Scan dates, triage, remediation, acceptance.

---

### 11. Exit States

**✅ Completed successfully** – Dependency vulns managed. **⚠️ Blocked** – Scanner or owner missing; resolve and re-run. **❌ Aborted** – Vuln management work cancelled; document; ensure critical vulns still tracked.

**Status:** Active Procedure  
**Owner:** Security / Platform
