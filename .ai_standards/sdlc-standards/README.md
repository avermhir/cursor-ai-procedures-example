# SDLC Standards

## Overview

This folder contains core SDLC standards, guidelines, and criteria that apply across all work in the organization. These standards define **what should be true** and **what to check against** - they are reference material used by procedures.

**Note:** These are **standards/guidelines** (reference material), not executable procedures. For executable workflows, see `.ai_procedures/`.

## Standards

1. **Repository Standards** - Standards for repository structure, organization, and conventions (pending definition)
2. **Branching & Naming Standards** - Git branching strategy and naming conventions (pending definition)
3. **Definition of Done Criteria** - Criteria that must be met before work is considered complete (pending definition)
4. **[Code Review Standards](./code-review-standards.md)** - Standards and best practices for code reviews
5. **Documentation Standards** - Requirements for documentation across the codebase (pending definition)
6. **Security Standards** - Security practices and requirements (see [security-standards](../security-standards/))
7. **[Testing Standards](./testing-standards.md)** - Testing requirements and standards
8. **Observability Standards** - Logging, metrics, and observability requirements (pending definition)
9. **Dependency Management Standards** - Standards for managing and updating dependencies (pending definition)
10. **Environment & Config Standards** - Environment variable and configuration standards (pending definition)
11. **[IaC Standards](./iac-standards.md)** - Infrastructure as Code standards and practices
12. **Data Standards** - Data modeling, storage, and access standards (including [Data Design Standards](./data-design-standards.md))
13. **Third-Party Integration Standards** - Third-party integration specifications and documentation standards (including [Third-Party Integration Standards](./third-party-integration-standards.md))

## Usage

These standards are referenced by procedures in `.ai_procedures/`:
- Feature Lifecycle procedures validate against these standards
- PR Lifecycle procedures check compliance with these standards
- Release Lifecycle procedures ensure standards are met before release

**Status:** IaC, Code Review, Testing, Data Design, and Third-Party Integration standards defined. Remaining standards pending definition.
