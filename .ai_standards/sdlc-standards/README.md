# SDLC Standards

## Overview

This folder contains core SDLC standards, guidelines, and criteria that apply across all work in the organization. These standards define **what should be true** and **what to check against** - they are reference material used by procedures.

**Note:** These are **standards/guidelines** (reference material), not executable procedures. For executable workflows, see `.ai_procedures/`.

## Standards

1. **Repository Standards** - Standards for repository structure, organization, and conventions
2. **Branching & Naming Standards** - Git branching strategy and naming conventions
3. **Definition of Done Criteria** - Criteria that must be met before work is considered complete
4. **Code Review Standards** - Standards and best practices for code reviews
5. **Documentation Standards** - Requirements for documentation across the codebase
6. **Security Standards** - Security practices and requirements
7. **Testing Standards** - Testing requirements and standards
8. **Observability Standards** - Logging, metrics, and observability requirements
9. **Dependency Management Standards** - Standards for managing and updating dependencies
10. **Environment & Config Standards** - Environment variable and configuration standards
11. **IaC Standards** - Infrastructure as Code standards and practices
12. **Data Standards** - Data modeling, storage, and access standards (including [Data Design Standards](./data-design-standards.md))
13. **Third-Party Integration Standards** - Third-party integration specifications and documentation standards (including [Third-Party Integration Standards](./third-party-integration-standards.md))

## Usage

These standards are referenced by procedures in `.ai_procedures/`:
- Feature Lifecycle procedures validate against these standards
- PR Lifecycle procedures check compliance with these standards
- Release Lifecycle procedures ensure standards are met before release
