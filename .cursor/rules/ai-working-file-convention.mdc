# .ai_working File Naming Convention

## Purpose
Files in the `.ai_working` directory should follow a naming convention to distinguish between temporary and permanent files.

## Naming Convention

### Permanent Files
- **No prefix**: Files without a prefix are considered permanent and should NOT be deleted during cleanup
- Examples: `ai-mistake-log.md`, `PR147_STATIC_ANALYSIS_REVIEW.md`

### Temporary Files
- **`temp_` prefix**: Files with `temp_` prefix are temporary working files that can be safely deleted
- Examples: `temp_analysis.md`, `temp_notes.txt`, `temp_pr_review.md`

## Rules

1. **Before deleting files in `.ai_working`**:
   - Check the file name - if it has no prefix, ask the user before deleting
   - Only delete files with `temp_` prefix during cleanup
   - Always confirm with user before bulk deletion

2. **When creating new files in `.ai_working`**:
   - Use `temp_` prefix if the file is temporary (e.g., `temp_plan.md`)
   - Use no prefix if the file should be kept long-term (e.g., `ai-mistake-log.md`)

3. **Git tracking**:
   - Files in `.ai_working` are typically gitignored
   - Permanent files should be considered important even if not tracked
   - Never assume a file is safe to delete just because it's not in git
