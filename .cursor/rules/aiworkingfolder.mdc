  CRITICAL: When creating temporary working files during AI sessions (analysis documents, investigation reports, review drafts, implementation plans, etc.), you MUST save them ONLY to the `.ai_working/` directory. Do NOT create temporary working files in the project root or other directories.

**Examples of files that belong in `.ai_working/`:**
- PR reviews and comments (e.g., `PR_41_REVIEW.md`)
- Implementation plans for specific features
- Investigation/analysis documents (e.g., schema mismatches, error analysis)
- Audit reports and findings
- Infrastructure fix documentation
- Session-specific requirements documents
- Any markdown files created for temporary reference or drafting

**Files that should stay in their proper locations:**
- Permanent API documentation (`docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- Project standards (`docs/PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`)
- Ongoing TODO/planning documents that are part of the project
- README files
- Configuration files

**Rationale:** The `.ai_working/` folder is gitignored to keep temporary AI session artifacts out of version control while maintaining a clean project structure.

**Enforcement:** All temporary working files created during AI sessions must be placed in `.ai_working/`. Files created elsewhere (root directory, `docs/`, etc.) should be moved to `.ai_working/` immediately.
