# Always Push After Commit

When making a local commit, **always push to remote immediately** after the commit succeeds.

## Rule

1. **After every `git commit`**: Immediately follow with `git push` to push the commit to the remote branch.

2. **If push fails**: Address any build/lint errors from the pre-push hook, then retry the push.

3. **Never leave local-only commits**: All commits should be pushed to remote unless there's an explicit reason to delay (and document why).

## Rationale

- Prevents loss of work if local machine has issues
- Ensures other team members can see progress
- Maintains consistency with remote repository
- Prevents accumulation of unpushed commits

## Exception

Only skip pushing if:
- Explicitly requested by the user to delay
- There's a known issue that needs to be resolved first (document it)
