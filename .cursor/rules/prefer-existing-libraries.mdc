# Always Prefer Existing Libraries

When generating or modifying code:

- Always search for established open-source libraries that solve the problem.

- Prefer solutions from reputable repos over writing custom implementations.

- If a suitable library exists, describe its usage and integrate it instead of reinventing functionality.

- If multiple libraries exist, briefly compare them and pick the best fit.

- Only write fresh code if:

 1. No reputable library exists,

 2. Using one would introduce unnecessary complexity, OR

 3. Integration cost outweighs the benefit.

- Before coding, list the libraries you considered and why you chose (or didn't choose) one.
