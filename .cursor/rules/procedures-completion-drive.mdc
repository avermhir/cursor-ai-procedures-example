# Procedures library completion drive

## Purpose

When working on the AI procedures library in this repo, **continue creating procedures until all procedure tasks in the beads plan are complete**.

## How to work

1. **Check ready work:** Run `bd ready` to list procedure-level tasks with no blockers.
2. **Claim work:** `bd update <id> --status in_progress` for the next procedure.
3. **Create procedure:** Add the procedure under the correct lifecycle folder using the [procedure template](../.ai_procedures/procedure-template.md) and existing procedures as reference. Follow the canonical structure (Purpose, Trigger, Required Inputs, Plan, Workflow, Output Contract, Validation, Downstream, Definition of Done, Audit, Exit States).
4. **Update README:** Add links and status (e.g. "All procedures defined") in the lifecycle folder's README.
5. **Close beads:** `bd close <id>` for each completed procedure; close the lifecycle phase task when all its procedures are done.
6. **Sync and ship:** `bd sync --no-daemon`, then commit and push. Reference beads IDs in commit messages when applicable.
7. **Loop:** Repeat until `bd ready` shows no procedure tasks, or the epic "Procedures library – complete all remaining lifecycles" and all its phase tasks are closed.

## When to stop

- All lifecycles in the beads plan have all procedures defined (Design System, Incident, Change Management, Data, AuthN/AuthZ, Third-Party, Testing & Quality, Security, Observability & Operations, Governance & Compliance).
- The epic and all phase tasks are closed.
- `bd ready` no longer lists procedure-creation work.

## Exceptions

- **User says stop:** If the user explicitly asks to pause or switch focus, obey that first.
- **Beads sync issues:** If `bd sync` consistently fails, commit procedure files and README updates anyway; note beads sync failure for manual fix later.
